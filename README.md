# KisanMitra-Ai-Powered-Agriculture-Chatbot

The **Farmer Support Chatbot** is an intelligent multi-language agricultural assistant designed to help farmers get instant solutions to their farming problems. It uses modern AI/LLM models to analyze user questions and provide accurate guidance related to crop diseases, weather conditions, fertilizers, soil issues, pest management, and general agricultural practices. The system supports multiple Indian languages such as **English, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam**, making it accessible for farmers across different states.

The application uses a **React-based frontend** for a clean and user-friendly interface, while the backend consists of **Flask (Python)** for chatbot logic and an **LLM API (Groq/OpenAI/Gemini)** for generating intelligent responses. The chatbot communicates with the backend through **WebSocket/HTTP** to give real-time AI-generated answers.

This project is designed to reduce dependency on agricultural officers by offering **instant guidance**, helping farmers identify crop problems early and improving overall productivity. It can be used in mobile devices or computers and includes features like multilanguage selection, disease detection help, farming tips, and continuous AI-driven support.
